## Waxxy

**Waxxy** is a lite social media and record cataloguing app that aims to provide the cratedigging community the services that GoodReads provides book-lovers, LetterBoxd provides for cinephiles, etc. That is to say, the a social forum built around a user's personal, physical music library. Using Discogs API, **Waxxy** will allow users to:
	-create a private account that will allow them access to a variety of features
	-OR just view album pages without logging in.  
A user can: 
	-curate a digital library of their vinyl collection
	-display favorites, custom shelves, and see recent activity
	-display a "now spinning" featured album
	-search for and add new records from the Discogs database
	-visit individual pages for albums and leave "liner notes", i.e. comments, plus see:
		-track lists
		-pressing info
		-liner notes from other users
	-visit show pages for artist that will display:
		-artist info
		-discography
