  "description": "**RECORD APP** is a lite social media and record cataloguing app that aims to provide for vinyl listeners the services that GoodReads provides book-loving users, LetterBoxd provides for cinephiles, etc. That is to say, the social aspect is secondary to the personal library/curation aspect - the focus is on simple, pleasing designs and artist/album data. Using Discogs API, **RECORD APP** will allow users to: \t-create a private account that will allow them access to a variety of features \t-OR just view album pages with no account.   USER will include the ability to:  \t-curate a digital library of their vinyl collection \t-display favorites, user-made shelves, and recent activity \t-display a \"now spinning\" featured album \t-search for and add records from the Discogs database on an index page where the 4 squares were \t-visit show pages for albums and leave \"liner notes\", i.e. comments, plus see: \t\t-track lists \t\t-pressing info \t\t-picture \t\t-YouTube link(maybe) \t\t-link to discogs marketplace(maybe) \t-visit show pages for artist that will display: \t\t-artist info \t\t-discography",
